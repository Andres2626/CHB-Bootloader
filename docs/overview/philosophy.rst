CHB Philosophy
==============

CHB is a boot manager project, born as an alternative to existing
ones (such as GRUB or LILO). Its main philosophy is simplicity and
minimalism. CHB provides a powerful and lightweight alternative
for loading and experimenting with kernels.

It is not intended to be a mini-OS like GRUB2, or a chain-loading
mechanism for a specific kernel.
