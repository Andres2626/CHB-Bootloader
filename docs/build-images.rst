CHB Build files:
================

**‘stage1.img’**

It is usually located in the first sector of the boot unit; this locates
and passes control to the 'loader'.

**‘loader.img’**

It is responsible for initializing the video system, VFS, FAT12,
obtaining data from memory, and finding and booting the kernel in the
FS.

**‘final.img’**

It is a combination of the 'stage 1' and 'loader' images; it does not
have the FS information necessary to read the kernel, but it is a
bootable and debuggable image.

**‘libchb_c.a’**

It is the minimal implementation of the functional C library in
'bare-metal' mode

**‘sizes.h’**

When compiling CHB, 'stage1' needs to know the size of the 'loader' in
order to load it; therefore, this is automatically generated by the
'size-test' script. This script contains the size of the 'loader' in
bytes.
