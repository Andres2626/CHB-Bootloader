That's it! Once CHB is installed on the formatted image, you can start
experimenting with your kernels. For now, CHB is a small bootloader, but
there are plans to add new features in the future.

At the moment, CHB doesn't support keyboard input or have a simple shell
that allows for further extensions to its functionality. All CHB does is
automatically load the kernel without any initial configuration.
