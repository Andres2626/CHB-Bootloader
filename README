**CHB LEGACY TERMINAL TEST (pre-0.01, 2023-2024)**

This is an early version of CHB, uploaded for historical purposes.

This version was created in 2023-2024, long before the official version 0.01 of this repository. 
Implements a shell with very simple commands in 'stage2'.

This branch is not intended to be merged with 'master' and is read-only. Its purpose is to show the 
old design and how CHB evolved from its initial form to its current state.

**NOTE OF BINARIES**

This version does not have compiled binaries, but the makefile compiles without issue; you can try 
it yourself and study its code.

**LICENSE**

The day this code was uploaded it was unlicensed, now it has the MIT license

IMPORTANT NOTE: This protocol of shell is deprecated, For the time being, the shell was removed from 
CHB due to the responsibility of a bootloader; likewise, a better system for loading files one by one 
was considered, thus avoiding excessive memory usage, and the bootloader is not a mini-OS like GRUB.

					CHB Notes and manual

Version: 0.01 Pre-Alpha (pre-official 0.01)


					0.	Introduction

(C)omputers (H)elp (B)ootloader is a two-stage bootloader
implemented for x86 architecture (x86_64, ix86)

This code implements a bootloader for x86 BIOS systems at the moment
CHB only support loading of binary files (not executables like-elf)

Anyone is FREE to contribute to the CHB project if they are interested. 
I encourage anyone interested in this project to contribute to it.
		
					1. Building Tutorial
					
To build CHB bootloader you must have the following tools
	
	1) GCC Cross compiler for x86_64 or ix86 that generates ELF 
	   files (I recommend that it be a version greater than 10.1.0)
	2) GNU-LD The linker for your compiler, that generates ELF files
	   for x86_64 or ix86 (I recommend that it be a version greater than 2.35)

The makefile doesn't do version checks for the linker and compiler because 
I don't know what older versions are like, If someone wants to make a port 
for previous versions of GCC, I encourage them to do so.

Well, if you already have all this you can continue with the tutorial

To build all CHB objects run this in your shell:

	./compile <your compiler prefix>

To see more information about this command try:
	
	./compile help

When CHB finishes compiling generates the following objects:

	1) stage1.IMG: The CHB bootsector, executes the kernel loader
	2) loader.IMG: this image contains the kernel loader
	3) CHB.IMG: is the union between stage1.IMG and loader.IMG
	4) sizes.h: This header file contains the size of the loader so that 
				it can be loaded by stage1, this file should never be edited, 
				it is autogenerated by the size-test.sh script
	
	

				2. How to Install CHB on raw image file
				
To install CHB on the image you need to create an empty image with dd (or the command of your preference):

	dd count=<your number of sectors> if=/dev/zero of=<your image name> bs=<your sector size>

Well, when you have the empty image created copy the CHB.img file to the 
first sectors of the disk:

	dd if=CHB.IMG of=<your image name> seek=0 conv=notrunc
	
Well done. You have an image with CHB installed!

Now, you can test the image with QEMU, BOCHS, or another debugger/emulator.



							3. Cleaning CHB
							
For clean CHB output files your try:

	./clean

		3. How to Install your kernel on formatted CHB image

CHB by default load the kernel in the fifth sector on the physical 
address 0x100000, in protected mode, you can change these parameters 
by editing the CHB code and recompile it.

You need a formatted image of CHB, and copy your kernel in the fifth 
sector of your image.

	dd if=<your kernel raw image> of=<your image name> seek=5 conv=notrunc


							4. CHB NOTES
	
* 	Your kernel MUST have compiled for 32-bit platform (iX86 or using -m32 compiler flag)
	CHB doesn't support long mode!

*	NEVER run the makefile directly, because the makefile needs a configuration 
	program beforehand, all of this is provided by the ./configure command. Also note 
	that the ./configure command should never be executed directly either because it 
	will not work to build/clear CHB, this script is only used as a configuration 
	for the makefile.

*	Note that the configure script is not the same as the script provided by 
	autoconf command.

	
						5. CHB PLAN (TODO list)
							
* Add support for filesystems (FAT, ext2)
* Load PE and ELF kernel files in memory
* Add C part in loader
* Fully support for Virtual File System (VFS)
* Load initrd file
* Support for multiboot specification
* Support for UEFI
* Support for non-x86 architectures (mips, arm)
* Support for x86 long mode
* Add command line
* Add support for Hard disk and CDROMS
* Implement full suport for extended disk read mode (INT13,42)
