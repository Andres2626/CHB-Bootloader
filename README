                                   **Version: 0.08-prealpha**

                                      0.	Introduction 

CHB (Computers Help Bootloader) is a two-stage bootloader targeting the x86 architecture, primarily 
intended for kernel bootstrapping and low-level debugging. The current implementation is minimalistic 
and features a FAT12 file system parser, addressing a limitation of the previous version that 
lacked support for loading kernels into dynamic sectors

Testing has been limited to x86 virtualized environments such as QEMU and Bochs, though it is 
expected to function correctly on any compliant x86 hypervisor or emulator.

                                  2.   Documentation notice

From now on, Sphinx will be used to build the CHB project documentation. Much of it has been 
rewritten, and new sections have been added. All documentation is now located in the 'docs/' 
directory.

Sphinx supports a wide range of formats for rendering documentation. CHB currently supports the 
following formats:

- html      -- Generate HTML pages
- latex     -- Generate .tex file
- pdflatex  -- Convert .tex to pdf
- htmlhelp  -- Generate windows CHM format 
- text      -- Generate text file

To build all the documentation, it is necessary to run:

    ./build.sh --docs=<supported-documentation-format>
    
For example:

    Generate HTML documentation:
    
    ./build.sh --docs=html

For more information, please see:

    docs/building.rst and ./build --help
    
                                3. Building Warning

Please note that there are 2 possible files that build CHB from source:
using Makefile or build.sh script. Building CHB directly with the
makefile is not recommended because the build script defines a series of
variables necessary to build CHB with cross-compilation.

To construct CHB correctly, refer to:                             

    ./build.sh --help
